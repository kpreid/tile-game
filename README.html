  <h2>Origin and gameplay</h2>
  
  <p>“Tile Game” was a game I wrote in the spring of 2010 as my final project for CI272 Visual Basic at <a href="http://www.mvcc.edu/">MVCC</a>. It was written in, of course, Visual Basic. However, I thought the game design itself was interesting enough to warrant porting it to JavaScript so it would have a wider audience.</p>
  
  <p>The concept is that you move within a 3-dimensional block world, can pick up objects and push boxes, and can't jump or climb. Your goal is to reach the exit; your obstacle is flows of water shifted by your actions. The game is turn-based: you move once, and the world reacts. You cannot outrun the water.</p>
  
  <p>Despite a resemblance in the types of blocks present, I completed this game before I ever heard of Minecraft.</p>

  <h2>The game</h2>

  <p>I have tested it to work on all browsers conveniently to hand. In particular, it is functional, but tediously slow, on the Android 2.2 browser, probably due to the scaled tile images. Firefox is slow when scrolling. The best performance I found is on Safari and Chrome; I particularly recommend playing in Chrome's full-screen mode.</p>

  <h2>Porting and technical notes</h2>
  
  <p>As of 2011-02-06, the port from the original VB code is now complete, other than some missing animation (specifically, there is no animation on win, and all but the last block of falling happens instantaneously). The approach for choosing the scale of the tiles could also use some improvement.</p>
